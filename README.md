# MailBatch Extension (de.systopia.mailbatch)

A simple CiviCRM extension to send out batches of mails, 
with a couple of features that CiviMail doesn't cover.

# Features

* Send out emails to selected contacts with attachments
* Will analyse upfront which recipients don't have eligible email addresses
* Attachments can be identified via contact ID, so you could, for example, send pre-generated PDFs
* Send emails based on a contribution selection, also with the system-generated invoice as an attachment 
* Can record the results as activities (sent, not sent incl. the error)
