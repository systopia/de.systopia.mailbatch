# Usage

### Selecting contacts

If you are working with MailBatch, the first step is to select the desired contacts to whom you want to send a mail.

* Filter out and select the desired contacts using a search function.
* From the **Action** list box, select the function **Send emails (via MailBatch)**.

### Choosing mail Settings

In MailBatch, you must or can specify certain settings with regard to the mail addresses and batch size.

* Select the desired sender mail address. The sender field is a required field.
* Decide whether you want to take a contact in copy or blind copy.

### Selecting a message template

You generally create message templates in CiviCRM via the **Mailing templates** function from the **Mailings** menu.

### Specifying file attachment

With MailBatch you can specify different mail attachments for the e-mails to be sent. If the desired mail attachment is not found or cannot be attached, you can allow MailBatch to send the mail anyway.
